    "root_cause": "In the line `v4 = &v9[read_num()];`, there is a vulnerability due to a lack of checking the range of the return value from the `read_num()` function, which could lead to out-of-bounds access. After the statement `free(v4);`, there is a potential issue since `v9[read_num()]` is not emptied or zeroed out, which may result in Double Free or Use After Free vulnerabilities.",
