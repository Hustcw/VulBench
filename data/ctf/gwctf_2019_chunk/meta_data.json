If `a2` is equal to the size of the `a1` memory, an off-by-null error will occur, causing a buffer overflow. In the `edit` and `show` functions, user input is read as an index into the `chunk` array, but there is no range check for the user input, leading to a potential out-of-bounds read/write vulnerability.",
