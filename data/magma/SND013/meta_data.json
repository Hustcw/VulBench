    ],
    "vulnerable_function": [
        "psf_binheader_writef"
    ],
    "root_cause": "In the 'S' branch of the switch statement, the size of psf->header.ptr is not checked to ensure it is greater than the size of the content being written. This could lead to a potential memory overflow issue since the subsequent writes include a 4-byte header_put_be_int(psf, size) and a memcpy(&(psf->header.ptr[psf->header.indx]), strptr, size + 1) of size + 1 bytes. Without proper checks, this vulnerability can occur."
