    ],
    "root_cause": "There is a divide-by-zero vulnerability when calculating `repeatX = result_width / surface_width` and `repeatY = result_height / surface_height`, as there is no check for whether `surface_width` and `surface_height` are non-zero values.\n\nThis means that if `surface_width` or `surface_height` are zero, the program will try to divide by zero, which can cause unexpected behavior or crashes."
