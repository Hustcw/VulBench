    "vulnerability_type": "Out of Bound, Out-of-bound Write",
    "vulnerable_function": [
        "XRef::getEntry"
    ],
    "root_cause": "In the XRef::getEntry function, there is no check for the range of 'i', which could exceed the 'capacity'. This can cause a buffer overflow vulnerability as '&entries[i]' is passed as the 'entry' parameter to the 'parseEntry' function and then modified, leading to out-of-bounds read and write issues."
