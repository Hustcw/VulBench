        "psf_binheader_writef"
    ],
    "root_cause": "In the 'S' branch of the switch statement, there is no check for the size of psf->header.ptr being greater than the size of the content being written. This could lead to memory overflow issues, as the subsequent write operations include the 4-byte header_put_be_int(psf, size) and a memcpy of size + 1 bytes from strptr to psf->header.ptr[psf->header.indx]. If no check is performed, memory overflow may occur. In the memcpy operation, padding is only added when the length of the string is odd, so using size + 1 as the length when the string length is even will cause out-of-bounds reads or memory overflows."
