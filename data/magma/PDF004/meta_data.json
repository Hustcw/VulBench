    "root_cause": "Before accessing the `allIntersections` array using the `intersectionIndex` variable in the line `const auto &line = allIntersections[intersectionIndex];`, there is no check to ensure that the `intersectionIndex` is within the bounds of the `allIntersections` array's size. This can potentially lead to out-of-bounds access vulnerabilities."
