    "vulnerability_type": "Memory Leak",
    "vulnerable_function": [
        "png_free_data"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is that the `info_ptr->free_me` attribute is not set to include the `PNG_FREE_EXIF` flag. This causes the `info_ptr->eXIf_buf` memory to not be freed during the cleanup process in `png_free_data`, resulting in a memory leak."
