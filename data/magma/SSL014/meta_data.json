    ],
    "vulnerable_function": [
        "ASN1_TYPE_cmp"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is that the variable 'a-type' is of type ASN1_TYPE, and within a switch statement, the V_ASN1_BOOLEAN branch uses ASN1_STRING_cmp to compare. This results in comparing a boolean type as if it were a char* type, leading to a type confusion vulnerability."
